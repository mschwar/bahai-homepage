# Bahá’í Daily Homepage

This is a minimalist personal homepage that displays daily Bahá’í Writings when you open your browser. It is designed to support spiritual reflection, routine, and detachment from digital distractions.

## Purpose

To create a sacred digital threshold — a homepage that centers the soul each time you open a browser window.

## Features

- Clean, beautiful typography and layout
- Daily quote display (currently uses a placeholder)
- Lightweight, fast, and works offline
- Fully customizable for your own use or to share with others

## How to Use

1. **Clone or download** the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser.
3. Set it as your browser’s homepage (Chrome, Firefox, Safari instructions in comments).
4. Optionally edit the HTML/JS to add new quotes or styles.
